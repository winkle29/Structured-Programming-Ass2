Component: < Task 6 -getViablePiecePlacements() and helping methods from FitGame class >

### Comments 

< The structure of the code is good. It is easier to understand the methods used for the task. Each method created is of good quality and decomposes the problem into simpler steps which makes code more organized. Code at created at each step is documented in simple language increasing the readability and purpose of the code. The code written follows the Java Code conventions as the variables and methods are created and named in an appropriate way. As task 6 is still under testing, it can be seen that the main code is ready and only small changes need to be made so that all the pieces are correctly chosen along with the given positions.   >
