Component: <Task 5 and code from PiecesOrientation Class>

### Comments 

<Best features of this code - the isPlacementValid method is compact and neat by creating lots of helper functions
 and then combining them all into one. 
 Is the code well-documented - the code is very well documented with comments throughout the code explaining what each 
 line of code represents or does.
 Is the program decomposition appropriate - Yes, by putting the helper methods in a separate PiecesOrientation
 class it keeps the FitGame class neat and readable.
 Does it follow Java code conventions - Yes, each method and all variables has an appropriate, descriptive and 
 concise name that tells the person reading the code what it does.
 I found no errors while going through the code>
