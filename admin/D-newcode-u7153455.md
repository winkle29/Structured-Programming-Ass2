For Deliverable D2D, I contributed the following new statements of original code:

- Added the [Slider and details](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7113879/comp1110-ass2-wed13m/-/blob/master/src/comp1110/ass2/gui/Board.java#L329-375) to Board to choose the difficulty level for a particular objective.
- Added the [newGame()](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7113879/comp1110-ass2-wed13m/-/blob/master/src/comp1110/ass2/Games.java#L163-179) method to get objective string placement for the chosen difficulty level.

(Follow the example give above to list at least 10 lines of original code contributions made by you. Notice that the example above links directly to the code as well as providing a brief description.   Please follow that example to link to your code.  You can create the link by browsing your code in gitlab, and then clicking on the line number of the first line, and then shift-clicking on the line number of the last line in the region you want to select.
