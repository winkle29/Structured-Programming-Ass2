Component: < Draggable class in Board class >

### Comments 

< In general, the codes written in Draggable class are of good quality. The best feature of the codes is the
functionality, in which the methods are significant in drawing and adjusting draggable pieces in JavaFX. The code is
well-documented with sufficient comments explaining what the codes do. The comments are simple and of proper language 
which makes it easy for others to understand. The program decomposition is also appropriate since the class variables 
are written before the methods. Readability is enhanced this way. The codes also follow Java code conventions since 
methods and variables are named properly using the right syntax, which reflect their true roles. The consistency 
of the style could also be seen throughout the class. From the codes, the program is expected to work perfectly without 
any errors. >
